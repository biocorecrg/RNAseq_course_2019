|from Wikipedia|


RNA sequencing, aka RNA-Seq, is a technique that allows to detect and quantify RNA molecules within biological samples by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). This technology is used to analyze RNA by revealing
* RNA/gene/transcript expression;
* alternatively spliced transcripts;
* gene fusion and SNPs;
* post-translational modification.

Other technologies for assessing RNA expression are Northern Blot [1], real-time PCR [2] and hybridization-based  microarrays [3].

<br/>

RNA-Seq can be performed using
* total RNA (in this case the content of ribosomal RNA is about 80%);
* rRNA depleted RNA (after removing ribosomal RNA);
* mRNA transcripts (by performing polyA enrichment of RNA); 
* small RNA, such as miRNA, tRNA (by selecting the size of RNA molecules; e.g., < 100 nt);
* RNA molecules transcribed at a specific time (ribosomal profiling);
* specific RNA molecules (via hybridization with probes complementary to desired transcripts).



Depending on the technology and the protocol, RNA-Seq can produce
* single-end short reads (50-450 nt), which are useful for gene expression quantification (mainly **Illumina**, but also **Ion Torrent** and **BGISEQ**);
* paired-end reads (2 x 50-250 nt), which are useful for detecting splicing events and refinement of transcriptome annotation;
* single long reads (**PACBio** or **Nanopore**), which are used for the de novo identification of new transcripts and improving transcriptome assembly. 



## mRNA-Seq protocol (Illumina)


|mRNA-Seq protocol|

|from Wang et al 2009 [4]|

### Library preparation

* **mRNA purification.** mRNA is isolated using a polyT adapter that binds to the polyA tail of RNA. In the result, non poly-adenylated transcripts - rRNA, tRNA, long ncRNAs, miRNA, histone mRNA, degraded RNA, bacterial transcripts, and many viral trascripts - are excluded from the reaction (washed away). 

* **RNA quantification, quality control and fragmentation**
<img src="images/illumina1.png" width="500" align="middle" />

* **RNA is converted to cDNA**

<img src="images/transcription.jpg" width="500" align="middle" />

During a typical RNAseq experiment the information about DNA strands is lost after both strands of cDNA are synthesized. There is however a number of methods for making stranded RNAseq libraries that preserve the strand information. (see for detail, [https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/))

One of such methods (shown below) is implemented in the Illumina's TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol that uses the introduction of dUTP instead of dTTP during the amplification. The incorporation of dUTP in the second strand synthesis quenches the second strand during amplification, because the polymerase used in the assay is not incorporated past this nucleotide.  
Stranded protocol allows detection of antisense molecules or genes in both 5' and 3' direction. 

<img src="images/stranded_protocol.png" width="500" align="middle" />

Note that in a stranded protocol shown here (in other protocols it can be different), Read 1 is mapped to the antisense strand (this is also true for single-end reads), while Read 2, to the sense strand.

|from [https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/)|


* **cDNA multiplexing** Fragmented cDNA is indexed with a hexamer or octamer barcode (so that cDNA from different samples can be pooled into a single lane for multiplexed sequencing).

|from [https://github.com/hbctraining/rnaseq_overview](https://github.com/hbctraining/rnaseq_overview)|



* **cDNA amplification** 

* **cDNA library quality control and fragment selection**

* **Sequencing**

The output of RNA-seq is then demultiplexed yielding either one fastq-file per sample (for single-end reads protocol) or two fastq-files per sample (for paired-end reads protocol).

### mRNA-Seq data analysis workflow



**put here a BIG PICTURE of data analysis**



### FASTQ format for sequencing reads

Short (and long) sequencing reads coming from the sequencers are stored in **FASTQ** format.
This format contains the information about sequence and the quality of each base, which encodes the probability that the corresponding base call is incorrect.

<img src="images/fastq_format.png" width="500"/>

The format contains four rows per sequencing read:
* a header containing **@** as the first character
* the sequence content
* a **spacer**
* the quality encoded using ASCII characters.

<img src="images/phred_quality.png" width="500"/>



* The Q score of 10 (symbol '+') corresponds to the probability that the base call is incorrect of 0.1.
* The Q score of 20 (symbol '5') corresponds to the probability that the base call is incorrect of 0.01.
* The Q score of 30 (symbol '?') corresponds to the probability that the base call is incorrect of 0.001.
* The Q score of 40 (symbol 'I') corresponds to the probability that the base call is incorrect of 0.0001 .



### RNA-Seq data repositories


The major repositories for gene expression data:
* [**GEO**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) 
* [**Array-express**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)
* [**ENCODE**](https://www.encodeproject.org/)

These repositoroes are linked to the repositories of NGS raw data (Fastq files):
* [**SRA**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (Sequence Read Archive) 
* [**ENA**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) (European Nucleotide Archive) 
* [**DDBJ-DRA**](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dra/index-e.html) 



**EXERCISE**
Let's explore one of the GEO records; that is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126535 
* Which platform and protocol were used for sequencing?
* What type of RNA was sequenced?
* How many samples were sequenced?


**NOTE: You will need to download data from SRA for an independent project after this week!**
To download raw data from **SRA**, it is possible to use **fastq-dump program** from [**SRA toolkit**](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc) or to download files from the NCBI ftp website using wget. 

For detail, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK158899/#SRA_download.when_to_use_a_command_line.

To download data, use a SRA identifier specifying whether reads are single or paired-end, otherwise paired ends will be downloaded as a single interleaved file; for paired-end reads use the parameter --split-files in fastq-dump. Fastq-dump adds SRA ID to each read in the file, to avoid it, use the parameter --origfmt. The parameter --gzip compresses fastq files immediately after download. The command below will download fastq-file(s) for one sample only (for example, using SRR identifier SRR8571764 from the exercise above; it is slow - it might take up to 30 -40 minutes):

```{bash}
fastq-dump --gzip --origfmt --split-files SRA-IDENTIFIER
```

To download all samples for a specific GEO experiment, use the SRA study identifier (e.g., for the GEO experiemnt considered above, it is SRP185848) and follow the following steps:
* First, download a list of SRR identifiers for all samples in the study by going to the NCBI SRA page for this study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?LinkName=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=522280 and clicking on the right top "Send" --> "File" --> "Accession List" --> "Save to file". That will give you the text file with all SRR identifiers for this study; save it for example as "sra_ids.txt". 
* Second, run the following command:

```{bash}

fastq-dump --gzip --origfmt --split-files $(<sra_ids.txt)

```


Another source of high quality data on gene expression in human and mouse is [The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)](https://www.encodeproject.org/). Using ENCODE portal it is possible to access data produced by members of the ENCODE Consortium and use them for further analysis.

For the purpose of this course, we downloaded the following ENCODE data:

1. [Homo sapiens A549 treated with 100 nM dexamethasone for 0 minutes](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR937WIG/)
2. [Homo sapiens A549 treated with 100 nM dexamethasone for 25 minutes](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR525HSH/)

|<img src="images/encode2.png" width="800" align="middle" />|


To download all fastq-files for this experiemnt takes a lot of time; therefore, to restrict the computation time of the analysis, we selected reads that are mapped only to the chromosome 10. Please run the following commands to obtain these files: 

```{bash}
wget https://public-docs.crg.es/biocore/projects/training/RNAseq_2019/resources.tar

tar -vxf resources.tar 

resources/
resources/A549_0_3chr10_1.fastq.gz

resources/A549_0_2chr10_2.fastq.gz
resources/A549_25_2chr10_2.fastq.gz

```

Let's inspect these files, count the number of reads, and check the read length:

```{bash}
zcat resources/A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz |more 

@D00137:455:HLFL3BCXY:1:1111:7527:60273/2

....

zcat resources/A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz | head -n 4 | tail -n 1 | awk '{print length($0)}'

```
</br>

**EXERCISE**
* Count the number of reads and check the read length for the first paired read for the sample called A549_25_3chr10.
* Count the number of reads in all fastq files (use for-loop).




### QC of sequencing reads
To assess the quality of sequencing data, we will use the programms **FastQC**[5] and **Fastq Screen**[6]. 

FastQC calculates statistics about the composition and quality of raw sequences, while Fastq Screen looks for possible contaminations. 

```{bash}
fastqc resources/A549_25_3chr10_*.fastq.gz

Started analysis of A549_25_3chr10_1.fastq.gz
Approx 5% complete for A549_25_3chr10_1.fastq.gz
Approx 10% complete for A549_25_3chr10_1.fastq.gz
Approx 15% complete for A549_25_3chr10_1.fastq.gz
Approx 20% complete for A549_25_3chr10_1.fastq.gz
...
Approx 85% complete for A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz
Approx 90% complete for A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz
Approx 95% complete for A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz
Analysis complete for A549_25_3chr10_2.fastq.gz
```

We can display the results with a browser; e.g., Firefox, for each file individually or all files with one command:
```{bash}
firefox resources/A549_25_3chr10_1_fastqc.html

firefox resources/*.html
```

<img src="images/fastqc.png" width="800"/>


Here we provide an example of a **bad sequencing**. As you can see, the average quality drops towards the 3'-end.

<img src="images/bad_fastqc.png" width="800"/>


Fastq_screen requires a number of databases to be installed for aligning a subset of your reads. You can download some pre-generated ones by using the following command (DO NOT LUNCH IT NOW!!!):

```{bash}
fastq_screen --get_genomes
``` 

This will download 11 genomes (arabidopsis, drosophila, E. coli, human, lambda, mouse, mitochondria, phiX, rat, worm and yeast) and 3 collection of sequences (adapters, vectors, rRNA) indexed with bowtie2. This step is quite slow so we are not going to launch it now.

To execute fastq_screen: 

```{bash}
fastq_screen --conf fastq_screen.conf A549_0_1_1.fastq.gz 
Using fastq_screen v0.13.0
Reading configuration from 'fastq_screen.conf'
Aligner (--aligner) not specified, but Bowtie2 path and index files found: mapping with Bowtie2

Adding database Arabidopsis
Adding database Ecoli
Adding database rRNA
Adding database MT
Adding database PhiX
Adding database Lambda
Adding database Vectors
Adding database Adapters
Using 7 threads for searches
Option --subset set to 100000 reads
Processing A549_0_1_1.fastq.gz
Counting sequences in A549_0_1_1.fastq.gz

...
```

Below is shown an example of the result aligning reads from fastq_screen.conf A549_0_1_1.fastq.gz to different databases to detect contaminations, failure of ribosomal depletion, and other artifacts of sequencing.

## Initial processing of sequencing reads

Before mapping reads to the genome/transcriptome or de novo assemblying them, the reads must be pre-rocessed as follows: 
* Demultiplex by index or barcode (it is usually done in the sequencing facility)
* Remove adapter sequences
* Trim reads by quality
* Discard reads by quality/ambiguity
* Filter reads by k-mer coverage (recommended for the de novo assembly)
* Normalize k-mer coverage (recommended for the de novo assembly)

As shown before, both the presence of low quality reads and adapters are reported in the **fastqc** output. 

Adapters are usually expected in small RNA-Seq because the molecules are tipically shorter than the reads which leasds to sequencing an adapter at 3'-end. Let's run FastQC on a fastq file for small RNA-Seq.


```{bash}
fastqc subsample_to_trim.fq.gz

Started analysis of subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
Approx 5% complete for subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
Approx 10% complete for subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
Approx 15% complete for subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
Approx 20% complete for subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
Approx 25% complete for subsample_to_trim.fq.gz
...
```


<img src="images/fastqc_small_rnas.png" width="800"/>


There are many tools for trimming reads and removing adapters, such as **Trim Galore!**, **Trimmomatic**, **Cutadapt**, **skewer**, **AlienTrimmer**, **BBDuk**, and the most recent **SOAPnuke** and **fastp** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423086). 

**EXERCISE**
Once you got the FastQC report (above), how to find out the sequence of the adapter to trim the reads?


Here we show the usage of **skewer[7]** indicating the Illumina small RNA 3' adapter.  

```{bash}
skewer subsample_to_trim.fq.gz -x TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG

.--. .-.

**EXERCISE**
Let's explore the tool **skewer[7]** in more detail using "skewer --help" command.
* Which parameter indicates the minimum read length allowed after trimming? And what is its default value?
* Which parameter indicates the threshold on the average read quality to be filtered out?
* Using skewer filter out reads in "subsample_to_trim.fq-trimmed.fastq" that have average quality below 40 and trim them on 3'-end until the base quality is reached 40. How many reads were filtered out and how many remained?
