## Introduction: what is RNA-Seq?

RNA sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used to detect and quantify RNA molecules within biological samples in particular time / conditions. In few words this technology is used to analyze the transcriptome by revealing:
* gene expression
* alternative spliced transcripts 
* gene fusion and SNPs
* RNA editing

Other experiments used for assessing the RNA expression are Northern Blot [1], Real time PCR [2] and hybridization-based  microarray [3]. 


RNA-Seq is used to analyze the continuously changing cellular transcriptome. Specifically, RNA-Seq facilitates the ability to look at alternative gene spliced transcripts, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusion, mutations/SNPs and changes in gene expression over time, or differences in gene expression in different groups or treatments.[5] In addition to mRNA transcripts, RNA-Seq can look at different populations of RNA to include total RNA, small RNA, such as miRNA, tRNA, and ribosomal profiling.[6] RNA-Seq can also be used to determine exon/intron boundaries and verify or amend previously annotated 5' and 3' gene boundaries. Recent advances in RNA-seq include single cell sequencing and in situ sequencing of fixed tissue.[7]
