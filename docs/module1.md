RNA sequencing is a technique that allows to detect and quantify RNA molecules within biological samples by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). In few words this technology is used to analyze the transcriptome by revealing:
* gene expression
* alternative spliced transcripts 
* gene fusion and SNPs
* RNA editing

Other experiments used for assessing the RNA expression are Northern Blot [1], Real time PCR [2] and hybridization-based  microarray [3].

RNA-Seq can be performed on:
* Only messenger RNAs by performing polyA enrichment. 
* total RNA, after a step of ribosomal depletion.
* small RNAs, selecting the size of RNA molecule (usually < 100 nt)
* Only RNA molecules that are being transcribed in that moment (ribosomal profiling).

Depending on the kind of sequencing the RNAseq can produce:
* Single short reads: particularly used for gene quantification (mainly **Illumina**, but also **Ion Torrent** and **BGISEQ**)
* Paired end reads: useful for splicing detection and annotation refinement
* Stranded or unstranded: the former allows detection of antisense molecules or genes on both directions, the latter is sometimes needed when very little amount of RNA is available. 
* Single long reads (**PACBio** or **Nanopore**): used for de novo identification of new transcripts / improving transcriptome. 

## mRNA sequencing
RNA is extracted and then converted to cDNA by using a polyT adapter that binds the polyA tail. In this way you non poly-adenylated transcripts like rRNA, tRNA and the majority of long ncRNAs are excluded from the reaction. 
cDNA molecules are then fragmented and eventually amplified by PCR and then sequenced.
