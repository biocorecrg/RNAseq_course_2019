RNA sequencing is a technique that allows to detect and quantify RNA molecules within biological samples by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). In few words this technology is used to analyze the transcriptome by revealing:
* gene expression
* alternative spliced transcripts 
* gene fusion and SNPs
* RNA editing

Other experiments used for assessing the RNA expression are Northern Blot [1], Real time PCR [2] and hybridization-based  microarray [3].

RNA-Seq can be performed on:
* Only messenger RNAs by performing polyA enrichment. 
* total RNA, after a step of ribosomal depletion.
* small RNAs, selecting the size of RNA molecule (usually < 100 nt)
* Only RNA molecule that are being transcribed in that moment (ribosomal profiling).
