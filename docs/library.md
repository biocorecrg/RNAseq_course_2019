# Library preparation

## mRNA purification

mRNA is isolated using a polyT adapter that binds to the polyA tail of RNA. In the result, non poly-adenylated transcripts - rRNA, tRNA, long ncRNAs, miRNA, histone mRNA, degraded RNA, bacterial transcripts, and many viral trascripts - are excluded from the reaction (washed away).
